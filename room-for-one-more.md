# Utah has a housing shortage 

The Room for One More campaign advocates for Logan to match other towns in Cache Valley by ending the prohibition on four unrelated people living in the same home. 

Allowing room for one more in Logan's existing housing supply is one of many needed steps to ease the town's housing shortage.

This is not just the practice of our neighbors like [North Logan](https://northlogancity.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/5_Boarders-and-Renters-in-Homes.pdf), but the practice of [college towns](https://cms9files.revize.com/loganut/departments/comdev/Neighborhoods/Moderate%20Income%20Housing%20Provisions%20Slideshow.pdf#page=42) across the country.

# In fact, allowing more than four is common in towns like Logan

For comparison, Bozeman, Montana, a place much like Logan, allows up to four people. [Boulder, Colorado](https://boulderbeat.news/2023/08/19/occupancy-limits-raised/), recently raised its rule to five unrelated people. Boise, Idaho allows two people per bedroom.

# Logan should make room for one more

Alone, making room for one more won't solve the housing crisis. But with a set of several changes, we can make Logan a place for people of all income levels.
