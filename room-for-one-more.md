Utah has a housing shortage. 

The Room for One More campaign advocates for Logan to match other towns in Cache Valley by ending the prohibition on four unrelated people living in the same home. 

Allowing room for one more in Logan's existing housing supply is a great way to ease the town's housing shortage.

This is not just the practice of our neighbors like [North Logan](https://northlogancity.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/5_Boarders-and-Renters-in-Homes.pdf), but the practice of [college towns](https://cms9files.revize.com/loganut/departments/comdev/Neighborhoods/Moderate%20Income%20Housing%20Provisions%20Slideshow.pdf#page=42) across the country.

# In fact, allowing mroe than four is common in towns like Logan

For comparison, Bozeman, Montana, a place much like Logan, allows up to four people. [Boulder, Colorado](https://boulderbeat.news/2023/08/19/occupancy-limits-raised/), recently raised its rule to five unrelated people. Boise, Idaho allows two people per bedroom.
